# Youtube-clone

So this was my project I've been working on for some time while learning Frontend in the background and applying knowledge to it. It is in dark mode by default because I
don't know how to implement other modes.

All icons that you see was made by me in Illustrator because I didn't want to use default Google images even though that would save a lot of time.

So if anyone looks at code you can see a lot of mistakes and problems that could be fixed but I purposefully left it there as a reminder to look back some day and see how much I've improved(and how bad I was back then).

Overall thoughts:

-I am satisfied with how it turned out, mobile version could be updated later maybe

-Learned a lot from past mistakes( code was changed many times during development )

-Optimistic about future projects
